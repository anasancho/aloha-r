# Assignment:

We've gone through the whole data viz pipeline and now you're equipped with a bunch of code to fetch some data, do some stuff with it, and then visualize it. It's time to go off-roading and learn how to tweak the code and workflow to a new dataset - the [Vancouver Crime Data](http://data.vancouver.ca/datacatalogue/crime-data-details.htm). 

## Your Task:

![](assets/img2/rleaflet-final.png)

Using the skills you picked up from the last 3 weeks, choose 1 year of data from 2003 to 2014 of **crime data** from the **Vancouver Open Data Catalog** and generate a visualization with the functionality of the interactive map above. Instead of the 3-1-1 call categories, you would imagine that crime types might fill their place. 

You should be able to tell some sort of narrative with your visualization. 

## Things to keep in mind:

* You will use R to make your mini-project.
* This is a quick mini-project and should not take more than 3 hours of class time + maybe a few hours outside of class. Stay focused.
* There's only 12 full years of data, meaning it probably makes sense for your to pair up and try to solve the problem in groups. Each person will have to submit an assignment, but **teamwork is encouraged**. Since there are 25 in the course, there should only be 2 years that are repeated 3 times. The other years should only be repeated twice. **We will choose in class so we all know who is working on which year**
* Comment your code and make sure it is clean and readable -and that it runs!

<!--# Assignment:

We've gone through the whole data viz pipeline and now you're equipped with a bunch of code to fetch some data, do some stuff with it, and then visualize it. It's time to go off-roading and learn how to tweak the code and workflow to the other 11 months of data. 

## Your Task:

Using the skills you picked up from the last 3 weeks, choose 1 month of data from 2014 of **3-1-1 data** and generate a visualization / series of visualizations showing aspects of the data. 

You should be able to tell some sort of narrative with your visualization-->
