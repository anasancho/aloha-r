# Download & Install R + R Studio
* First: download and install [R](http://cran.stat.sfu.ca/) - make sure you download the right one for your system.
	* For Windows users, you can choose between 32-bit and 64-bit versions of R, you need to choose which one is right for your computer. If you're really unsure, then choose the 32-bit, BUT if you don't mind google searching "32-bit or 64-bit windows for <insert computer model here>" 
* Second: download and install [R studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/#Desktop) (make sure to install R first!)
